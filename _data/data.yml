    details: |
      I have worked across many different job roles with my local council. I have experience of some description at every age range including exposure to nursery settings, a number of primary schools, one secondary school, and several out of school clubs. This includes both faith schools and non-denominational ones. My duties run the gamut from personal care and providing medication and meals, to preparing and differentiating mainstream classwork to suit the needs and abilities of the children I work with. Some settings were more casual and concerned with ensuring that young people have a safe space to meet with their friends. Working in teams and forming effective relationships with the children were of parmount importance.

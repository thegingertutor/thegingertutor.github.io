              <h3><span style="color: white;">I have played the bagpipes for
                  over 25 years now, and started when I was a young boy. <br>

            <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: white;">That was
                with my local pipe band where I soon graduated from their novice
                section to their juvenile section. I have competed with a number
                of pipe bands with success, winning prizes in nearly every
                competitive grade going except for grade 1. <br>
              </span></div>
            <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: white;"><br>
              </span></div>
            <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: white;">I have
                also been both Pipe Sergeant and Pipe Major of both community
                based and competition oriented bands, where I was responsible
                for leading bands on parade and at practices, and helping ensure
                a musically satisfying performance was achieved. To that end I
                utilised a number of teaching aids and resources from
                organisations such as the College of Piping and Royal Scottish
                Pipe Band Association to develop both learners and more adept
                playing members abilities.<br>

            <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: white;">Away from
                pipe bands I have spent some time studying pibroch or 'ceol mor'
                on an individual basis. This is highland clan music that was
                historically played by soloists to mark special occasions such
                as winning or losing battles, notable deaths and births, as well
                as more pastoral fare where tunes commemorate fields, caves and
                sometimes even cows!<br>
                <br>
                As a solo piper, I have played at many events - weddings,
                funerals, birthdays and hogmanay are staples where a Scottish
                flavour is added. Less common is for highland dancers, where
                particular tunes are requested to match particular dances. I
                have also branched out into composition - which was a
                requirement for studying music at high school - and have even
                released some books of music myself, independently.</span></div>
